        I was 7 years old when I went to school. A big school with around 500 students. 
        I remember my first teacher who taught me to read and write Farsi. 
        It was great to be able to do it for the first time. I continued in college and high school in Tehran.
        I was interested in physics and mathematics, so I chose mathematics in high school and software engineering in university. 
        I became interested in artificial intelligence, so I decided to study this field in my master's degree.
